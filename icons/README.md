So the structure of this directory is supposed to make it easier to find and 
organise the icons from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/). The 
folder structur is the author's name on the site (maybe url username is 
better?)--however, these icons can be renamed with values that are better 
suited to their purpose for SlamData. Also it's preferred to name as 
`${noun}-${adjective}`.
